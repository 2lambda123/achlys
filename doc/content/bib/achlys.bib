This goal can be achieved through rate equations models as presented here. We calibrate our models with thermal desorption spectrometry results to obtain a validated set of material parameters relevant to hydrogen inventory processes in bulk tungsten. The best fits are obtained with two intrinsic trap types, deep and shallow, and an extrinsic trap created by plasma irradiation and plastic deformation of the tungsten matrix associated with blister formation. We then consider a realistic cycle of plasma discharges consisting of 400s of plasma exposure followed by a resting period of 1000s, repeating for several hours. This cycle is then closed by a long “overnight” period, thus providing an estimate of the amount of tritium retained in the PFCs after a full day of standard operation.}

The influence of a-priori known thermal field has also been included. To ensure the solution convergence and the numerical stability, the trapping kinetic is introduced by using an approximation of the analytical solution the McNabb and Foster equation. Comparisons with a relevant 1D MRE code and with thermal programmed desorption (TPD) experimental results are performed on a 1D configuration to validate the model. Next, the model is used to simulate the tritium diffusion and trapping in a 2D geometry of interest in the upper plug of ITER tokamak, and results of tritium inventory are compared with an equivalent 1D calculation.}

Deuterium retention has been investigated as a function of ion fluence, implantation temperature, incident energy and surface conditions. Special attention has been given on the investigation of D retention in thin films of tungsten carbide and tungsten oxide which can be formed on W surface in a fusion device. Such kinds of films increase the D retention in W. Several points are reviewed: (i) inventory in pure W, (ii) inventory in W pre-implanted by carbon ions and (iii) inventory in tungsten oxide.}

Three types of traps are found: two intrinsic traps (detrapping energy of 0.87 eV and 1.00 eV) and one extrinsic trap created by ion irradiation (detrapping energy of 1.50 eV). Then MHIMS is used to simulate HIs retention at different fluences and different implantation temperatures. Simulation results agree well with experimental data. It is shown that at 300 K the retention is limited by diffusion in the bulk. For implantation temperatures above 500 K, the retention is limited by trap creation processes. Above 600 K, the retention drops by two orders of magnitude as compared to the retention at 300 K. With the determined detrapping energies, HIs outgassing at room temperature is predicted. After ions implantation at 300 K, 45% of the initial retention is lost to vacuum in 300 000 s while during this time the remaining trapped HIs diffuse twice as deep into the bulk.}

FESTIM has been validated by reproducing experimental data and the Method of Manufactured Solutions was used for analytical verification. Following relevant plasma scenarios, both transient heat transfer and hydrogen isotopes (HIs) diffusion have been simulated in order to assess HIs retention in monoblocks. Relevant materials properties have been used. Each plasma cycle is composed of a current ramp up, a current plateau, a current ramp down and a resting phase before the following shot. 100 cycles are simulated. The total HIs inventory in the tokamak during resting phases reaches 1.8×10−3mg whereas during the implantation phases it keeps increasing as a power law of time. Particle flux on the cooling channel of the monoblock is also computed. The breakthrough time is estimated to be t=1×105s which corresponds to 24 cycles. Relevance of 2D modelling has been demonstrated by comparing the total HIs inventory obtained by 2D and 1D simulations. Using 1D simulations, a relative error is observed compared to 2D simulations which can reach -25% during the resting phase. The error during implantation phases keeps increasing.}

	journal = {Physica Scripta},
	abstract = {Based on macroscopic rate equation simulations of tritium migration in an actively cooled tungsten (W) plasma facing component (PFC) using the code MHIMS (migration of hydrogen isotopes in metals), an estimation has been made of the tritium retention in ITER W divertor target during a non-uniform exponential distribution of particle fluxes. Two grades of materials are considered to be exposed to tritium ions: an undamaged W and a damaged W exposed to fast fusion neutrons. Due to strong temperature gradient in the PFC, Soret effect’s impacts on tritium retention is also evaluated for both cases. Thanks to the simulation, the evolutions of the tritium retention and the tritium migration depth are obtained as a function of the implanted flux and the number of cycles. From these evolutions, extrapolation laws are built to estimate the number of cycles needed for tritium to permeate from the implantation zone to the cooled surface and to quantify the corresponding retention of tritium throughout the W PFC.}

The present work aims at the clarification of the H retention mechanisms with critical review of reported data and presentation of recent results. H diffusion coefficient for dissolved H in W is large enough to allow for a deep penetration of H into W bulk. Energetic H loading results in H saturation in the subsurface layers. The thickness of the saturated layers could grow under prolonged loading and the H in the layers remain long or hard to remove. Both the growth of the thickness of the saturated layers and the deep penetration of H into the bulk could result in significantly large H retention in W and dissipate the advantage of W as plasma facing wall.}
