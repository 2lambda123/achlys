# Examples

## 1. 1D diffusion with single trap

This example aims to demonstrate a simple set-up to get started with and provides a comparison
between the Achlys numerical estimation and an exact analytical solution.

- [Example 1: Analytical](analytical/analytical.md)

## 2. Thermal Desorption Spectrum

This more involved example is a key use-case for the code.
This procedure aims to model the experiential work of [!cite](OGOROD2003).
