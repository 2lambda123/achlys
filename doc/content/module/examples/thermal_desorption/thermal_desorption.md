# Thermal Desorption Spectrum

This more involved example is a key use-case for the code.

This procedure aims to model the experiential work of Ogorodnikova et al. [!cite](OGOROD2003).

The original experiment [!cite](OGOROD2003) involves a thin tungsten foil $12 \times 15 \times 0.5 \: \text{mm}^3$.
The foil is exposed to a beam of 200 eV deuterium ions during an initial implantation phase which 
lasts 400 s. This is followed by a resting phase of approximately 5 minutes at a constant 
temperature of 300 K. Finally, the rate of desorption of hydrogen from the foil is measured as the 
temperature is slowly increased at a constant rate of 8 K/s.
